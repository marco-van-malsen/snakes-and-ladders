This project extended the original design by:
- retaining the simulation option
- adding animation
- allowing game-play for 1-4 players
- adding numbers to tiles
- highlighting start and finish in red
- allowing grid-sizes 10x10, 12x12 and 14x14
- making number of snakes and ladders selectable
- creating non-overlapping snakes and ladders
- adding histogram showing player progress
